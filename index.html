    <p>Succulent plants are typically drought-resistant and have leaves, stems or roots that become unusually fleshy because they store water in their tissues. Plants that are adapted to dry and harsh environments, such as succulents, are known as xerophytes. However, not all xerophytes are succulents, because some plants have developed unique characteristics such as small leaves which can roll-up or leathery leaves instead of succulent leaves. Similarly, not all succulents are xerophytes, as some plants classified as succulents are also aquatic plants.</p>

  <div class="class=pothos">
    <h2>Pothos</h2>
    <img src="img/pothos.jfif" alt="A picture of a pothos" class="centered-image">
    <p>Pothos is an evergreen plant with thick, waxy, green, heart-shaped leaves with splashes of yellow. As a houseplant, it is commonly grown as a hanging plant. Pothos can climb by means of aerial roots, and wild or cultivated plants grown outdoors can reach enormous heights using tall trees as support.</p>
